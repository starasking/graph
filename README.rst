This repository is my personal study and summary of graph structure-related problems and algorithm applications, as well as some thoughts. The gradual implementation of the algorithm is promoted in the form of themes, for example, logical continuation, multiple applications based on the same basic algorithm, exploring different technic for the same problem, and so on.

For example, around DFS in a directed graph, algorithms for 5/4 related scenarios are implemented in one series, including: topological sorting, determining whether there is a cycle in the graph, extracting strongly connected components in the graph, and extracting all simple cycles, etc.
